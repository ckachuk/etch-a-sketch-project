The project is about etch-a-sketch

I did the following steps to develop this project:

-Make the grid which is default 
-Add event handlers in the grids 
-Paint the cell 
-Generate buttons which change the patron of paintcell 
-Make the function of clear grid and clear color of the grid
-Generate grid of different size

This project is part the The Odin Project's curriculum.
